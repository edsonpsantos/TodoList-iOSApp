# To-Do List iOS App

## 📱 About this project
This project refers to a simple iOS mobile application to show a type of folder organization using MVVM architecture and other features

I will build a to-do list from scratch using SwiftUI with an MVVM architecture pattern. I will also incorporate UserDefaults into the application to save and persist data between sessions, user experience, and animations. 

I will also adapt the app for iPad, Landscape, Dark Mode a specific App Icon, and a Launch screen to SwiftUI.

The repository contains all code based on an MVVM architecture with Swift and SwiftUI.

##  👨🏽‍💻 Technologies and Techniques used:
* Swift
* Swift UI
* MVVM Architecture stands for Model-View-ViewModel
  
   - The Model contains logic for the data layer.
  
   - The View contains logic for the app's UI.
  
   - The ViewModel contains the business logic for the app, connecting the View to the data (Models)!
  
* Good practices 🚀
